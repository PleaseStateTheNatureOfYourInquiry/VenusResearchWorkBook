# VenusResearchWorkBook

In this public repository I share my Venus research advances. This is very much work in progress. 

In order to use the scripts that are in this repository, it is necessary to download and install two other toolsets I developed: 
[GeneralTools](https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/GeneralTools) and [VenusTools](https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/VenusTools).

In the project top-directory of a research project (for example Temperature-UVBrightness-Project) is a file called analysisConfiguration.py. Here a few paths have to be defined that are subsequently used in the scripts of the project. At the time of writing these are paths to data folders on your computer.

At this point my subset of the Venus data sets is not yet included, as it is quite large and I still need to find a good place to park it online.

The detailed description of the work is in the files in the docs section. These are compiled and can be viewed at the [Venus Research Workbook at ReadTheDocs](https://venusresearchworkbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
