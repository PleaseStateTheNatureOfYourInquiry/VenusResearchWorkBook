# VenusResearchWorkBook

In this public repository I share my Venus research advances, thoughts and struggles of the **Search for a correlation between temperature structure and UV contrasts in the clouds of Venus** project. This repository and corresponding ReadTheDocs pages are thus a work in progress.

In order to use the scripts that are in this repository, it is necessary to download and install two other toolsets I also developed: 
[GeneralTools for Scientists](https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/GeneralToolsForScientists) and [VenusTools](https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/VenusTools).

In the project top-directory (`Temperature-UVBrightness-Project`), there is a file called `analysisConfiguration.py`. 
It contains a paths that are used in the scripts throughout the project pointing to the data and to sub-folders in the project. 

The (sub)set the Venus Express data I used for this project is freely available from the ESA Planetary Science Archive.
To make life easier, for now (November 2024) it is available as a [downloadable WeTransfer zip-file](https://we.tl/t-JGq0pLkuCV).


A detailed description of the data, the files, the scripts and all the work and its irregular flow is in the files in the docs section. 
These have been compiled to a nice html-format and can be viewed at  
[Venus Research Workbook at ReadTheDocs](https://venusresearchworkbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
