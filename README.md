# VenusResearchWorkBook

In this public repository I share my Venus research advances. This is very much work in progress. 

In order to use the scripts that are in this repository, it is necessary to download and install two other toolsets I developed: 
[GeneralTools](https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/GeneralTools) and [VenusTools](https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/VenusTools).

In the project top-directory is a file called analysisConfiguration.py. Here some paths have to be set that are used in the scripts. These are mostly paths to data folders.

At this point my subset of the Venus data sets is not yet included, as it is quite large and I still need to find a good place to park it online.
