# VenusResearchWorkBook

In this public repository I share my Venus research advances. This is very much work in progress. 

In order to use the scripts that are in this repository, it is necessary to download and install two other toolsets I developed: 
[GeneralTools for Scientists](https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/GeneralToolsForScientists) and [VenusTools](https://github.com/PleaseStateTheNatureOfYourInquiry/VenusTools).

In the project top-directory, for example `Temperature-UVBrightness-Project`, is a file called `analysisConfiguration.py`. 
it contains a few paths that have that are used in the scripts throughout the project.
At the time of writing these paths are to data folders on your computer.

At this point the subset the Venus Express data I used is not yet included: it is quite large and I still need to find a good place to park it online.

The detailed description of the work is in the files in the docs section. These are compiled and can be viewed at the [Venus Research Workbook at ReadTheDocs](https://venusresearchworkbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
